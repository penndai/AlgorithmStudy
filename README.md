# AlgorithmStudy
some algorithm study cases, including:

1. AreStringsAnagrams
2. FibonacciNumber -- which is loop through and quick method to get fibo number
3. CalculateWays -- recursive method and slowly to get the fibo number
4. FibonacciSeries -- another loop through and quick method get fibo number
5. PrintPascalTriangle -- In Pascal triangle, the first and the second rows are set to 1.
   Each element of the triangle (from the third row downward) is the sum of the element directly above it and the element to the left of the element directly above it. See the example Pascal triangle(size=5) below:
		/// 1				
		/// 1	1			
		/// 1	2	1		
		/// 1	3	3	1	
		/// 1	4	6	4	1
6. IsPalindrome -- Write a function that checks if a given sentence is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or 
	     sentence that reads the same backward or forward. Only the order of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z) should be considered, other characters should be ignored.
		   For example, IsPalindrome("Noel sees Leon.") should return true as spaces, period, and 
		   case should be ignored resulting with "noelseesleon" which is a palindrome since it reads same backward and forward.
